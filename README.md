# Bible Mood App

Welcome to the Bible Mood App! This application provides relevant Bible verses based on your current mood, offering spiritual encouragement and inspiration tailored to your emotional state.

## Overview

The Bible Mood App is designed to be simple yet powerful. With an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), you can input how you are feeling, and the app will suggest Bible verses that resonate with your mood.

## Features

- **Mood Detection**: Enter your mood and get suggested Bible verses that match.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and simple GUI for ease of use.
- **Persistent Data Storage**: Mood and verse mappings are stored in a JSON file.
- **Search and Sort (Upcoming)**: Advanced search options to find specific verses and sort them according to preferences.

## Getting Started
